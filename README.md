# Hyperspectral Vegetation Analysis

This project focuses on quantitative vegetation assessment using hyperspectral imagery (HSI).  
Multiple vegetation indices were derived and spectral profiles were analyzed at selected pixel locations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook performs:

- Multi-index vegetation analysis
- Pixel-level spectral signature extraction
- Spectral profile visualization using loop-based implementation

---

## 🌿 Vegetation Indices Implemented

- **NDVI** — Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  
- **NDRE** — Normalized Difference Red Edge Index  
- **GNDVI** — Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  
- **RVI** — Ratio Vegetation Index  

Each index was computed using hyperspectral band selection and array-based operations.

## 📊 Spectral Profile Analysis

Spectral signatures were extracted from five selected pixel locations:

- (Row = 40, Column = 100)
- (Row = 50, Column = 200)
- (Row = 60, Column = 300)
- (Row = 70, Column = 400)
- (Row = 80, Column = 500)

Profiles were visualized to analyze reflectance variation across spectral bands.
